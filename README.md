<h1>JavaScript_Projects</h1>

These are some small projects I have made using JavaScript.

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>

 <li><a href="https://github.com/josephlister/JavaScript_Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe">Tic-Tac-Toe Game</a></li>
 <li>Calculator</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pizza Menu</h4>

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a variety of topping selections.  It uses the input data to calculate a price for your order.

<h4>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h4>

This is the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.  Players decide which token to be, the game randomly decides who will make the first move, and the winner is celebrated with music.

<h4>Calculator</h4>

Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
